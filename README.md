# Raine's 3AIR Script Repository
miscellaneous things i do in S3AIR's Lemonscript. _they aren't mods in of themselves_, they're intended for others to use _in their own mods_.
## Using the Scripts
most of the time i will specify if something was directly built off of something else (typically S3AIR's base code), but in any case, because of my edits or whenever the code is purely my own, credit is preferred and **required** in my books.

please do not leave me uncredited purely out of spite, you won't be doing yourself any favors
